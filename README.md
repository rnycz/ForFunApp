Here you can see how many points you already have and your email address. <br />
You can choose the game you want to play and add bonus points.<br />
At the moment there are three options: Jumper, Dodger and Shooter.<br />
In Jumper, you need to go up as quickly as possible.<br />
In Dodger you have to dodge objects that fall from above.<br />
In Shooter you have to shoot the monsters that are coming to you and score points.<br />
